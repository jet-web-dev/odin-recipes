    <img src="../images/pao-de-queijo.jpeg" alt="Busty Brazilian Boba" />
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The first time I had these was at a Brazilian Steak house here in Austin, Texas. The texture of these little cheese puffs is a combination of crispy outside and chewing inside. The final result of the dough is pretty runny so you will need to cook them in a mini muffin cups.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cupts tapioca flour</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
        <li>In the mean time bring the milk, salt, and butter to a boil in a sauce pan while constantly stirring mixture.</li>
        <li>Once boiling remove the mixture of milk, salt and butter from heat.</li>
        <li>Slowly add tapioca flour, stirring constantly until thoroughly mixed.</li>
        <li>Add the cheese and eggs to the mixture.</li>

        <li>Fill each mini muffin cup all the way.</li>
